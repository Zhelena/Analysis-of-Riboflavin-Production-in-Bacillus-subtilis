This is a dataset of riboflavin production by Bacillus subtilis containing 71 observations, 4088 predictors (gene expressions) and a one-dimensional response (riboflavin production). The data can be accessed via https://rdrr.io/rforge/hdi/man/riboflavin.html. This is large-p small-n problem, variable selection seems applicable. The number of models chosen is not limited, but at least two methods learned from the course ($Nonparametric\ Statistics$)should be included. Find the most appropriate model and explain it. A printed report is required.
