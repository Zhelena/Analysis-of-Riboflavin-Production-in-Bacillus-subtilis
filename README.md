`finalproject2024.docx` is the requirement of the project .

Dataset of riboflavin production by Bacillus subtilis containing n=71 observations of p=4088 predictors (gene expressions) and a one-dimensional response (riboflavin production). This data can be accessed via "riboflavin" in the R package "hdi". This is large-p small-n problem, variable selection seems applicable. The number of models chosen is not limited, but at least two methods learned from the course ( $Nonparametric$ $Statistics$ ) should be included. Find the most appropriate model and explain it. A printed report is required.

The R files are codes of the project, named by the models.

The csv files are intermediate datasets —— `riboflavin.csv` is the original data, `riboflavin2.csv` is the data after PCA and `riboflavin2_boxcox.csv` is the data after PCA and Box-Cox Transformation.

`Pre.pdf` is the PPT I used for presentation.

`Report.pdf` is the report of the project.
