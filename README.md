Dataset of riboflavin production by Bacillus subtilis containing n=71 observations of p=4088 predictors (gene expressions) and a one-dimensional response (riboflavin production). This data can be accessed via "riboflavin" in the R package "hdi". This is large-p small-n problem, variable selection seems applicable. The number of models chosen is not limited, but at least two methods learned from the course ( $Nonparametric$ $Statistics$ ) should be included. Find the most appropriate model and explain it. A printed report is required.
