Consider the data-set of riboflavin production by Bacillus subtilis containing n=71 observations of p=4088 predictors (gene expressions) and a one-dimensional response (riboflavin production). You can access the data via https://rdrr.io/rforge/hdi/man/riboflavin.html 

Apparently, this is so called large-p small-n problem, variable selection seems applicable. You can choose methods as many as possible, however you must include at least two methods learned from our courses in your project. Find the most appropriate model in your mind and explain it.
